# Under The Waves - UEVR Smart First Person Mod

## Overview
This Mod adds an optional 'smart' first person camera to the game when on foot or swimming. The Mod will dynamically switch to cinematic cameras when appropriate, and back again to first person view once done. It also adds the ability to toggle the headlamp on the diver, and headlight on the submarine.

## Key Features

* **First Person camera**: Fully immersive VR-style first person view.
* **Auto-Switch for Cinematics**: Switches to 3rd person during cutscenes, scene reveals, key interaction scenes, and other scripted events. Restores 1st person automatically when done (if you were in it).
* **Headlamp & Effects**: Diver spotlight attaches to your head in first person for a proper headlamp feel, can be toggled on/off, and the volume/brightness of the light is tweaked to look better in VR.
* **Submarine Headlight**: The sub's spreadlights can now be toggled on/off.
* **HUD Adjustments**: Custom HUD positioning for 1st person (helmet-style), 3rd person, and menus.

## Controls

* **First Person camera**: Left Stick Click
* **Headlamp (diver), Headlight (sub)**: DPAD Up
* **HUD Visibility**: DPAD Down


## How to install and run

1. Download and install UEVR injector from [HERE](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases/tag/nightly-01125-778168d4a5cffe81b1ce4be3b0f17df3a2e970ad)
 (This is the latest version confirmed to work with the MOD. Anything later should also be fine).
2. Download the Under The Waves Mod from [HERE](https://github.com/Rusty-Gere/Under_The_Waves/releases/download/v.1.1/UnderTheWaves-Win64-Shipping.zip)
3. Run the UEVR injector, then click "Import Config" in the left-hand menu.
Navigate to where you saved the MOD, it should be named "UnderTheWaves-Win64-Shipping.zip", select the file and click Open to import. A File Explorer window will open, you can just close that again, the file is now imported.



4. With UEVR injector running, launch the game, tab to UEVR injector, locate the game in the process dropdown list, and click Inject.


>[!TIP]
>Grab [Raipal](https://github.com/Raicuparta/rai-pal) and use that instead to simplify the whole injection process.

> [!NOTE]
> * When the game starts for the first time with this MOD installed, you will see a custom UI with the Features and Controls overview.
> If it doesn't show by itself, hit the Ins key or click both controller sticks, then click on the WAVE tab.
> * No 6DOF controls, as interactions are done cinematically. Even so, having a proper 1st person camera for exploration adds significantly to the immersion, making this a much more VR style experience.
> * Some objects fade out when you approach them in 1st person. This is the game forcing transparency when close to the camera. 
> * The Mod dynamically changes the render mode to minimize stutters and flickers in various scenes. Should you encounter any flickering, simply pause and unpause to fix it.
> * Some actions require switching to 3rd person, e.g. pushing against certain objects. You'll know when it happens.
> * Dev'd and tested on Quest 3 using XBox controller, with Steam version of the game.
